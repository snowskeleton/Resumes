To Whom it May Concern,

I'm applying for the Web and Site Reliability Engineer position because I have a strong history with a variety of programming languages,
but specifically Swift through my work on iOS apps.
Also, I've been involved with music from a very young age,
taking lessons in guitar and trumpet.
Even still I sign in a choir, with our Christmas concert just last Sunday.

I have some experience with AWS,
specifically their Lambda and API Gateway technologies,
through a website I made a couple years ago for taking polls,
akin to Strawpoll.com

I've worked on various open source projects with a multi-national team,
so remote collaboration won't be a problem.

I look forward to hearing back from you soon about this opportunity.

Regards,
Isaac
